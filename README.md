# Tower of Hanoi
This C++ program simulates the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle using a 2D array. The Tower of Hanoi involves moving a stack of disks between three rods, with the constraint that only one disk can be moved at a time, and a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.

### Features
* Modular Design: The program is well-structured, featuring modular functions for display, move validation, and solving the puzzle.
* Dynamic Initialization: Users input the number of disks, and the program dynamically initializes the towers and disks in a 2D array.
* Random Moves: The program employs a random number generator to simulate moves, adding variability to each run while adhering to the Tower of Hanoi rules.
* Move Validation: Before executing a move, the code checks its validity, ensuring compliance with Tower of Hanoi rules.
* Output and Statistics: The program outputs the number of moves required for solving the puzzle and displays the final tower configuration.

### Usage
1. Compile the program.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter the number of disks when prompted.
O4. bserve the simulation until the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is successfully solved.

### Code Structure
The code is easy to understand and modify, featuring functions for different aspects of the puzzle. Users can uncomment specific code sections to visualize intermediate steps during the simulation.

Feel free to explore and enhance this C++ Tower of Hanoi simulation for educational purposes or as a basis for further algorithmic problem-solving projects.

`Note: Some commented-out code for displaying intermediate steps is included but can be uncommented for a more detailed visualization of the simulation.`
